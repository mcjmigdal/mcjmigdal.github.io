<div class="section" id="brief-overview-what-is-molecular-docing">
<h1>Brief overview - What is molecular docing?</h1>
<p>Molecular docking is a technique/method used to predict structure of the intermolecular complex, formed between two or more molecules. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id29" id="id1">[1]</a> Those molecules could be ligand
and some protein, but also complex of two proteins. The docking problem may be
formally stated as falows: <em>Let A,B be two molecules, than we would like to find a
transformation T that the score measuring the quality of the
proposed docking solution is maximized</em>. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id30" id="id2">[2]</a> Looking at this definition we can find
two key indigridents in molecular docking: transformation - so we need  a way to
generate or explore different structures of complex between two molecules, and a score
that will tell us which of those structures is best. Before we look into these in more
detail, I would like to tell more about what is molecular docking exacely by looking
at some examples of its usage.</p>

<div class="section" id="applications-it-s-not-only-drug-design-tool">
<h1>Applications - it's not only drug design tool</h1>
<p>Molecular docking is most widely used in field of drug design, to find/propose the binding mode of protein inhibitors. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id29" id="id3">[1]</a> However it's applications examples can be also found in other fields some of them are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>nanotechnology it is used to deduce orientation of protein on nanoscale surfaces, which appears to be quite important when integrating preoteins into nano-devices.

</ul>
<p>Lets take a closer look for some of these.</p>
<div class="section" id="anti-biofouling">
<h2>(Anti)biofouling</h2>
<p>Biofouling is the process of accumulation of microorganisms, plants, algae, or animals on wetted surfaces.
This phenomena presents a significant problem especially in marine industry, where buildup of
biofouling leads to higher fuel consumption and even destruction of vessel.[3]_ Because the
group of fouling agents is quite diverse designing specific antifouling agent is not so easy.
One of very potent antifouling agents was butenolide 1, and though it's antifouling activity was
validated no informations aobut it's mode of action were available. This problem find it
solution in molecular docking which provided answers and showed that butanolide acts in quite
different way on different fouling agents eg. In <em>Balanus amphitrite</em> it coused distrupion of ketone body
synthesis, or in close relative <em>Balanus neritina</em> it disrupted lipid metabolism. (2012study). The above study provided exhaustive insight into antifouling agents and their mechanism of action. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id32" id="id7">[4]</a></p>

<dd>Nanotechnology
One of fields in which nanotechnology is being implemented is design and validation
of biosensors. A variey of nanoparticles are available like silca, gold. The deduction
of orientation of protein on nanoscale surfaces finds vital insinuations in
integrating proteins onto micro and nonofabricated devices. Although, nanoparticles
have been successfully implemented by the scientific community in terms of structure,
stability and activity of proteins attached on the surface of nanomaterial. yet understanding
the mode of action and the binding of these nanoparticlles to their specified target
is still subject to discussion, which is greatly answered by computional tools, incuding
molecular docking.
Molecular docking use example: A hybrid system containing a protein-fuctionalised nanoparticle
for a protein from Moringa oleifera, which possesses anti-coagulant and anit-microbal proberties
has been prepared. Yet becouse of scare information on this protein molecular docking as well as
MM was employed to unravel them. Using knowlege gained throu this computional experiments sciencist
gain knowlage about nature of interaction within binding site that let them successfully design
suitable nanoparticle for this hybrid system. (Okoli et al 2013) <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id32" id="id8">[4]</a></dd>

<dd>Biodegradation
Synthetic dyes such as azo or trienylomethane are being widely used in
today industry. Alarming rates of release of coloured compounds into the
environment poses a serous thret to the ecological balance especially to
marine fauna as these dyes act as chemical mutagens. This drives studes
of finding ways to biodegradate those chemicals. One of the enzyme capaple
of doing this is triphenylmethane reductase produced by Citrobacter sp.,
and it was found that it is more active towards malachite green. Molecular
docking was the technique employed to investigate mechanism under this
process and was able to succesfuly predic and characterize binding pocket
of triphenylmethane reductase therby facilitating better understanding of
the enzyme behaviour. This example shows how the use of computional tools,
like molecular docking could prove benefical in unravelling novel methods of
bioremediation. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id32" id="id9">[4]</a></dd>

<div class="section" id="study-of-fatty-acid-biosynthesis">
<h2>Study of Fatty Acid Biosynthesis</h2>
<p>Interest in fatty acid biosynthesis recently has been growing due to
biofuels which are emerging as a potent replacment to fossil fuels. Especially microalgae are being considered as an extremely potential source, considering the
high amounts of lipids they could acumulate in theirs cells. As it appears two enzymes are important for this process: FabH involved
in elongating the fatty acids chains, and acyl carrier protein (ACP) which catalyses the
transfer of fatty acids intermediates to the
active sites of FabH. Moleular modeling followed by molecular docking studies of the interaction
mechanism between those two revealed strong hydrogen bonding between the two proteins.
Moreover specific residues involved in this interactions were unrevealed. Hence, this
ilustrates how computation chemistry approaches can be implemnted is such studies and
also in designing mutation studies that could be vital in increasing the synthesis of biolipids
in algae -- what is currently a goal in this field.(Misra, Patra, Panda, Sukla 2013). <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id32" id="id10">[4]</a> Also notice that this is example of protein - protein docking usage.</p>

<dd>Study of Nutaceutical Interactions
Nutraceuticals are -
The role of digestive nezymes in breaking macromolecules present in food into smaller units
has been elaborately studied and docuented. The intervention of theese enzymes is pivotal in
for example afcilitating the adsorption of food particles. Example use of docking in this
field is studing relations between inhibiting ability of some nutaceuticals an inhibiting
factors causing prostae cancer. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id32" id="id11">[4]</a>
Neutraceuticals is a broad term that is used to describe any product derived from food sources
with extra health benefits in addition to the basic nutritional value.</dd>

<div class="section" id="how-it-work-s">
<h1>How it work's</h1>
<p>As I already have told before.
The docking procedure, or so called <em>docking problem</em>, can be divided into two:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Prediction of the intermolecular complex structure</li>
<li>Evaluation of the generated structure <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id29" id="id12">[1]</a></li>
</ol>
<p>(1)The most intuitive approach to the first problem would be a <em>hands-on</em> approach (according to Leach) which requires a good idea of the expected binding mode, for example we already know the binding mode of a closely related ligand. However, it has been showed that even very similar inhibitors might adopt quite different binding modes. Moreover if one would want to dock large number of inhibitors by hand it would cost lot of time, not to mention that human modelers can be biased and programs usually can consider many more possibilities. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id29" id="id13">[1]</a></p>
<p>The second problem comes from the fact that usually there are no simple answers and most docking algorithms generates a large number of possible structures, thus we need a way to score those different possibilities in order to select a single one. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id29" id="id14">[1]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="docking-alghoritms-prediction-of-ligand-pose">
<h1>Docking alghoritms -- prediction of ligand pose</h1>
<div class="section" id="how-complex-the-docking-problem-is">
<h2>How complex the <em>docking problem</em> is?</h2>
<p><em>Docking problem</em> involves many degrees of freedom:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>six degrees of translational and rotational freedom of one molecule relative to other</li>
<li>conformational degrees of freedom of <strong>each</strong> molecule</li>
</ul>
<p>Such a large number of df, makes considering all of them probably impossible.
Thus many different strategies have been devised to deal with that problem.
Those strategies or alghoritms, can be characterized according to the number of df that they ignore. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id29" id="id15">[1]</a></p>
<p><em>The simplest alghoritm treats the two molecules as rigid bodies and explores only the six degrees of
translational and rotational freedom</em> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id29" id="id16">[1]</a> More advanced method could treat one molecule
as rigid and other as flexible and so on.</p>

<h2>DOCK - one of earlies alghoritm example</h2>
<p>Dock is one of the first docking alghoritms and a example of most simple one.

even earlier attempts</em>) it was designed to find molecelues with a huge
degree of shape complementarity to the binding site and this idea of using shape complementarity
between two bodies is beeing inherited also by other newer programs.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>::</dt>
<dd>To do so it first derives a 'negative image' of the
binding site from the molecular surface of the macromolecule. This negative image consist of collection of
overlapping spheres of varying radii, each of which touches the molecular surface at just two points. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id29" id="id17">[1]</a>
Next stage is to look for clusters of those spheres, the existence of this kind of clusters indicates the
existance of a cavity in the molecular surface, which is considered to be a good docking site. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id30" id="id18">[2]</a> Ligand
atoms are then matched to the sphere centers to find sets of ligand atoms in which all the distances between the
atoms in the set are equal to the corresponding sphere centre-sphere centre distances ( <em>with some user
predefined tollerance</em>). <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id29" id="id19">[1]</a> This is done only by translations and rotations. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id30" id="id20">[2]</a> The ligand can then be oriented withing the site by performing a least-squeres fit of
the atoms to the sphere centers, then orientation is checked to ensure there are o unacceptable steric
interactions between the ligand and the receptor. If the orientation is acceptable then an interaction energy
is computed to give the 'score' for that binding mode. New orientations are generated by matching different
sets of atoms and sphere centers. The top-scoring orienations are retained for subsequent analysis. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id29" id="id21">[1]</a>
The main feature that should be noted here is that whole docking procedure is based
on shape complementarity between two bodies.</dd>

<div class="section" id="flexible-docking-alghoritms">
<h1>Flexible docking alghoritms</h1>
<p>As people tried to improve prediction capabilities of docking software they devised flexible docking. Performing conformationally flexible docking requires taking into account conformational df.
Many of the methods tries to deal with this problem by considering only the conformational space of
the ligand, while receptor is assumed to be rigid. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id29" id="id22">[1]</a>  Hopefully to those programs this assumption of protein ridigity is often a fair aproximaton, as protein usually doesnt change much on binding ligand.
Thus this comes to a similar problem as searching a optimal conformation.There are number of algorithms used to solve this kind of
problem and their are used in  molecular docking as well includong Monte Carlo, genetic algorithms, distance geometry,ant-colony optimization, etc.,
there is quite a number of these in fact and probably all of them have been used in some program. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id29" id="id23">[1]</a></p>
<p>Although I sad that many programs consider only conformational space of ligand, this is not true for all of
them. In fact number of programs that includes flexibility of protein and ligand is quite large already,
however the degree to which proteins are consider flexible is varying from side-chains only in some part of
protein to full protein flexibility. For example GalaxyDock accounts for protein flexibility of
pre-selected residues, RosettaLigand implements full protein backbone and side-chain
flexibility and even posibility to simultaneous dock multiple ligands. AutoDock takes into
account flexibility by separating choosen side chains and making them part of ligand input. An
so on numbers of different solutions are possible today (cIFD, RosettLigand, AutoDock, AutoDock Vina).[7]_</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Methods combining docking with molecular dynamics are also available. Those are used when no
crystallographic data is available for a given target. In these approach accepted view is that
greater sampling of biomolecular space is desirable to find optimal solution. But the main
obstacle is short timescale accessible to MD simulations. These are tried to be overcome by
increasing speed and efficiency of both algorithms and computer hardware (ex. GPU accelerated
computing). One such example is MM2QM tool which allowed combining the docking, MD, MM and QM
calculations for either generation of alternative protein receptor conformations or
optimization of final docked structures. [7]_
</pre>
<pre class="literal-block">
For example, **Monte Carlo** methods have been used to perfom molecular docking, often in conjunction with
 simulated annealing. In this method at each iteration the interal conformation of the ligand is changed
 (by rotating about a bond) or the entire molecule is randomly translated or rotated. The energy of the
 ligand in the binding site is calculated using molecular mechanics and the move is then accepted or
 rejected.[1]_
</pre>
<pre class="literal-block">
Another example is the use of genetic algorithms, in this approach each chromosome codes not only for the
internal conformation of the ligand but also for the orientation of the ligand within the receptor site. Both
the orientation and the internal conformation will thus vary as the population evolve - the score of each
docked structure within the site acts as the fitness function used to select the individuals for the next
iteration. [1]_

Before you can use genetic alghortim to solve a problem you must find a way to encode
any potential solution to that problem using binary bit string, which is refered as
a chromosome.
At the begining large number of random chromosomes are generated, and each one
presents a potential, yet random, solution to the problem.
Then each chromosome is scored on how good it solves the problem using fitness funtion
Than selectad pairs from the current population are choosen based on this score
to survive to the next population, in the same time offspring population is being
generated from those choosen. During generation processes like crossover and mutation
are beeing mimic.

<dd>Ant colony optimization, in this method set of software agents called artifical ants
search for good solution to a given optimization problem. To apply this methodology
problem has to be first tranformed into problem of finding the best path on weighted
graph. Then the ants incrementally build solution by moving on the graph.</dd>
</dl>
<pre class="literal-block">
Distance geometry can be used to perform molecular docking. The major problem to be addressed with this method
is to find a way to generate confomations of the ligand wihtin the binding site. One way to achieve this is by
using a modified penalty function that forces the ligand conformation to remain within the binding site. For
example, and additional penalty term can be added which has the effect of forcing the ligand to lie in the
DOCK-derived cluster of spheres that represents the binding site. [1]_

Finding coordinates of set of points by using the distances between some pairs of
such points.
</pre>
<pre class="literal-block">
Another approach used by many programs involves the incremental construction of the ligand. This is similar in
spirit to the depth-first systematic conformational search. The main difference is that in docking the
 conformational search is performed within the binding site. Typical incremental construction algorithm first
identifies one or more `base fragments` within the ligand. These base fragments are often chosen to be
reasonably significant, fairly rigid part of the molecule such as a ring system. The base frament(s) are
docked into the binding site and may then be clustered to remove similar orientations. Each docked orientation
of the base fragment then represents starting point for the conformational analysis of the rest of the ligand.
This approach might be quite time consuming - since it is necessary to perform the conformational analysis for
each orientation of the base fragments. However, it is often found that the protein provides a particulary
useful constraint, enabling the search tree to be pruned very effectively. [1]_

<div class="section" id="more-theory-scoring-functions-for-molecular-docking">
<h1>More theory - scoring Functions for Molecular Docking</h1>
<p>Docking algorithms are generally capable to generate a large number of potential solutions.
Some of these can be rejected immediately because they have a high-energy clash with the
protein. But the remainder must be somehow assessed - this is done using scoring function. We
should consider two situations when we scoring functions are used: <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id29" id="id24">[1]</a></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>We are interested in how a single ligand binds to the protein</li>
<li>We are interested in docking large number of molecules to protein of interest and deciding which one is the best match - virtual screening (VS).</li>
</ol>
<p>a) In the first situation, scoring function must be able to identify the <cite>true</cite> docking mode of
a given ligand, moreover this scoring function should be calculated rapidly because of large
number of orientations that may be generated during docking run.
b) However in second case, when docking more than one molecule -- say database of molecules, it
also needs to be able to rank one ligand relative to another. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id29" id="id25">[1]</a></p>
<p>Most commonly used are emiprical based scoring functions, they usually take into account the
size of the contact surface between the two molecules and they do not allow one molecule to penetrate
the other. They also tries to approximate the ligand-receptor binding energy using very fast
and approximate method. Usually those consider free energy of binding written as an additive
equation of various additive components to reflect various contribution to binding, example
of how such equation could look like is presented at the slide.[2]_</p>

<p>As you may notice good scoring function is crucial both for docking single molecule as for VS.
With out good scoring function even if alghoritm behind docking allows to explore great number of binding
poses it wont be able to choose a proper one correctly or rank different ligands based. Empirical functions
about which I have told you are still beeing developed and it is mainly concerned with one or more term
contributing on overall binding affinity.</p>
<p>There are however also atmepts to use higher-level theories such as QM. A major limitation is of course
computational cost of first-principles calculations, nontheless some development is taking place in this area
ex. Rao et al. derived such scorring functionand tested it on two sets of molecules with satisfatorily results.</p>
<p>Yet as for now none methodology is superior and docking programs tends to be target specific. So it is resonable
when choosing docking program to try out more than one.</p>

Research by M. Bajda and others from Jagiellonian University was focused on
acetlcholinesterase, enzyme responsible for acetlcholine hydrolisis in cholinergic

<p class="last">The aim of the study was to find more potent drug via virtual scanning techniques and
ZINC database. The ZINC database is a free data set of commercially available compounds,
frequently used to vritual screening. In contains over 35 million compounds. The VS
done reasearchers was done in a multi-step manner. First they chosen only those compunds
that had important physicochemical properties like proper absorption and distribution
to central nervous system. In the next step they used information on structure of
acetylcholinoesterase in complexes with four different inhibitors to create a
pharmacophore models (<em>Pharmacophore is an abstract description of molecular features
that are necessary for molecular recognition of a ligand by a biological macromolecule</em>)
,that purpose they used special computer program. Using that model they performed
another screening on remaining compounds. Now the fit quality of the compounds to
features described by a pharmacophore model was used as filtration criteria and allowed
to choose 88 compounds for futher screening. This was done using molecular docking, and
filtering criterion was score obtained with the ChemScore scoring function (which is
popular scoring functions available in Discovery program). Number of compounds was
further narrowed to 7, which was belived as resonable number. However this studies were
unable to find any new potent drug, as all 7 compunds were less effective than drugs
available on the marked, they nicely show the frame work. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id33" id="id27">[5]</a></p>

<p>Study by group from Italy was focused on finding new inhibitors mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers

those proteins are dysregulated in several cancer types, they belive that employment of
inhibitors specific to those carriers might be crucial for inducing apoptosis in cancer cells.</p>
<p>In order to find new potent inhibitors they constructed model of ADP/ATP carrier based on
homological structure, from bull which shares ~90% of identical residues
and using Modeller. As for collection of compounds to screen they have
used KEGG ligand database, but only compounds greater than 10 atoms and lighter than 1200
g/mol. Docking-based virtual screening (Virtual screening is computional technique used in drug discovery
to search libraries of small molecules in order to identify new potent drugs against some target) was conducted
using AutoDock and took <strong>2 months</strong> for
completing the screening of the entire library. This allowed to choose 13 best molecules. In
further research it was found that 2 of them showed good results and high selectivity,
comparable or better that previously known inhibitors. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id34" id="id28">[6]</a></p>

<dd>In one of the steps during preperation of docking simulation it neccecary for AutoDock and
many other programs to specify, grid box. This is simply a space in which the program will
tries to dock the ligand. Obviously such grid box should contain active site within it. In
order to do that they took the protein they used for modeling the structure of their target,
namely BtAAC1 in complex with its inhibitor CATR. And tried to redock that inhibitor into
protein using different setting to a grid box sizes. During those preparation reserchres were
able to successfully redock ligand back into protein, this also gave them a good insight into
residues involved in substrat binding/recognition. It was shown that in binding site of two
homologs percentage of identical residues was greater that 98%, thus justyfing used methodology.
As I want to present you one of the free
docking servers (swissdock) I though it would be good example to try and repeat redocking as
thay did, however with different program as they used AutoDock.</dd>
