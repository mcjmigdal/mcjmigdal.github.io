<li>Structural DNA nanotechnology - DNA usage for protein</li>
</ol>
<p>Welcome every one, I think I don't have to indroduce myself, but in case there is my name in the corner :). Today I would like to tell you something about role of DNA in nanotechnology, and I hope you will find my talk interesting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Traditionally, DNA is thought as a genetic information storage. However from about 25 years, DNA began to find new roles and applications as a very useful material, especialy in nanotechnology and molecular biology. There is vast number of different applications that DNA started to be used for. Some of the examples are genetic engineering where through DNA manipulations we can manipulate protein structure, also there is idea to store digital information on DNA and it is getting more and more popular. Other examples are DNA computers, becouse as it apears thanks to well know hybridization DNA can be used to solve mathematical problems. More over there are examples DNA structures with catalitical properties, thus DNA catalysis is also rapidly growing field or other DNA structures called aptamers have been found to be able to bind to broad range of molecules with high specifity and affinity.pause.DNA give lot of opportunities and hopes for future technology and becouse this number of different fields, where DNA finds its application is so large I have decided to focus just one, as to give some overview of what is possible with DNA.</p>
<p>The field that I have choosen is material science, or as I would say now structural DNA nanotechnology. By most my choice of this particular field was driven by the fact that I found the achivements of DNA structural nanotechnology interesing. But now from better perspective I think that the choice was good becouse, on some level of complexity in structural DNA applications people are trying to utilize also all the other possiblities offered by this important material.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="structural-dna-nanotechnology">
<h1>Structural DNA nanotechnology</h1>
<p>Structrural DNA nanotechnology is a field of science in which resarchers are using DNA as a bascic building block for nanostructures. This definition is far from perfect but I hope that on the way you will get an idea of what structural DNA nanotechnology is. The field of structural DNA nanotechnology can be tracked back to crystallographer named Ned Seeman, who in 1982 came up with an idea that DNA can be used as a mean to organize proteins into three-dimensional crystals, so that he could study their structure using X-ray crystallography. He started his research first by constructing quite flexible branched DNA structures. Then the developent in this field  progressed to the fabrication of more rigid DNA tiles (p³ytka), which could be used to assemble higher-order periodic and aperiodic lattices and nanotubes. Although it all started with an idea of single man on how to make crystalography easier now days there is more than 50 labs in the world that are dealing with structural DNA nanotechnology and are focused in more general on mastering techniques to shape DNA-based materials.[2]
As you may suspect there are some features about DNA that makes it a good material for nonotechnology applications. There are 3 such characteristics and sometimes they are called pillars of structural DNA nanotechnology:[2]
#. hybridization
#. stably branched DNA
#. convenient synthesis of designed sequences</p>
<p>Hybrydyzation is a self-association process of complementry nucleic acid molecules, a key aspect here is the use of sticky-ended DNA fragments. The very same process that is fundamental component of genetic engineering. Special feature of sticky-ended cohesion is that two sticky ends can cohere with each other in a specific and programmable fashion. Moreover sciencists are able to predict structure formed by those piecies. This feature is uniqe between other biologically based interactions, becouse the structure of product formed when two sticky ended strands cohere can be determined only based on thier sequence.[2]</p>
<p>Second pillar that structural DNA nanotechnology is based on are stable branched DNA structures - although DNA double helix is the best-known DNA structure, in fact best-know strucutre in biology. DNA is capable to take branched forms as well.
For example, recall branched replication forks that can be observed during DNA replication or branched Holiday junctions that are intermediates in genetic recombination (schemat on the slide). If you think about it, it turns out that with out those branched forms little biology would occur, likewise is in DNA nanotechnology where ability to create branches makes constructing DNA based materials possible.
However as you may know biologically derived branched DNA molecules, such as Holliday junctions, are unstable. This is becouse they exhibit sequence symmetry - In Holliday junction the four strands acctually consist of two pairs of strands with the same sequence. This symmetry enables an izomerization that allows the branching point to relocate. Thus making it unstable. However this phenomena can be easly eliminated if one chooses sequences that lack symmetry in the vicinity of the brnach point.[2]</p>
<p>This takes us to 3rd pillar of structural DNA nanotechnology, which is synthesis of designed sequences. Becouse the designed sequences, the sequences we would like to use, are not readliy obtained form natural sources the capability to synthetize sequences as needed is crucial for this field. Hopefully today it is possible to order any DNA we want litterally via internet, so the only limitation might be a price (100$ for ~300bp and 300 ng).[2]</p>
<p>First approach to DNA materials is called multistranded approach. Based on the self-recognition properties of DNA the so called branched motifs were designed. These motifs those are different ways to produce branches. Using multiple strands you build those branched motifs that can be further used to assemble even more complex structures. Despite undenaible validtity of this multistranded approach, becouse its is correct way of thinking, complexity of structures that can be achived in this way is limited to simple geometric shapes and repetition of basic building blocks. More over when using this approach you have to provide large amounts of different short strands.</p>
<p>Nontheless using this method the first DNA constructions were build. The earliest DNA constructs were floppy and not rigid meaning that thier topologies were well-defined but their detailed structure was not fixed. Idealized pictures of these molecules are showed on the slide. First one is a cube and second truncated octahedron.</p>
<p>Newer and much more exciting technology allowed to construct more rigid structures. The method is called DNA origami, it entails the use of a scaffolding strand to which a series of helpper stands are added. The helper strands are used to fold the scaffolding strand into a well-defined shape. The whole process apears not be only fairly simple but also give high yields of products. The general idea is well ilustrated on the slide, but if you are not sure I also found a move.</p>
<p>The emergence of DNA origami was like a breakthrough for the field and the best know example of DNA origami was publication by Rothemund (2006). He demonstrated that he was able to take single stranded M13 viral DNA, of 7.3 kb long and get it fold into a variety of shapres, including smiley face. All those structures were generated by following the very same design rule, which takes us to the most exciting part that once you have your shape in mind it is easy to have computer program handle generation of helper strands, needed to fold DNA into desired shape. To show you the scale of those structures the lower edge of rectangle in column b is about 100 nm. Also the images below visualisation were obtained using AFM. As you might notice all these structures made by Rothemund in 2006 are 2D.</p>
<p>AMF and scale</p>
<p>However the very same design principles are used today to generate 3D objects as well. A well know example is a DNA box with a lid on the top that can be opened and closed with a &quot;key&quot;. On the slide you can also see a bottle and tube-like structures.</p>
<p>DNA origami has been widely  used since it's introduction to build many different 3D objects, some of them have find thier usage in biophysics, as a rulers to measure other biomolecules.
Now I would like to show you some more exciting applications that could be addressed using this technology.
However before that I would like to underline that DNA nanotechnology is still in its infancy thus the applications I'm going to show you are still under development and probably far from large scale usage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dna-enzymatic-reactors">
<h1>DNA enzymatic reactors</h1>
<p>One of the amaizing things you can observe in nature is cooperative usage of different enzymes, that are putted close to each other to enchance some reaction. Or if they are taking part in different processes they might be put in different compartments of the cell. Although creating such artificial systems that can position and cofine different enzymes is still far from complexity achieved by nature, controlling chemical reactions by using nanoscale reactors is an active area of reaearch where DNA nanostructures might be found usefull. As you have seen aleardy varieity of different structures are available thaks to DNA origami but how to attach enzyme to such DNA nanostructures? It turns out that enzymes can be directly conjugated to an oligonuclotide or they can be attached through a specific binding motif, so DNA-binding proteins could be used as adaptors. In general the most important thing here is to mantain enzyme activity.
At the figure you can see an ilustration from 2015 publication, in this paper scientist describe an nanoscale enzyme reactor, that consisst of two distinc tubular 3D DNA origami. In part A of this figure you can see one such unit. Take your attention to fragment labeled NTV which is biotin based linker, through this linker it is posible to connect enzymes. In this case those were glucolse oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The two units, with different enzymes attached were fabricated separately and then 'glued' together via DNA base pairing. The catalytic activity of a two-unit nanoreactor was then monitored and it was showed that reation rates could be imporved in this way comparing to native structures.</p>
<p>Besides the static nanoreactors which one example you have just seen, there are examples of nanodevices that can control enzyme activity through motion. One such example that I found is shown at the slide, in this model once again GOx-HRP cascade were used to demonstrate that such reactions can be regulated through use of nanotweezers. This DNA motor can be switched between a open and close states by addition of 'fuel' strand' that causes strand displacement. Becouse limiting factor in this reaction is diffusion time of intermediates between two enzymes, upon device opening the reaction rates decreaces.</p>
<p>Synthetic transmambrane chanells are thought as very usefull devices, they have been proposed as components of drug-delivery system, as antimcirobial agents, biosensors, filters, photosystems, catalysts and tools for biology - DNA sequencing. Creating such channels requires ability to tailor architectures with a high level of customizability and precision, which creates a great oportunity for structural DNA nanotechnology. In last year a cooperation of people from UK, Germany and US resulted in creation of the largest synthetic pore in lipid membrane ever. The nominal cross section of this DNA porin is 6 nm, which is comparable to diameter of nuclear pore.  This DNA origami porin was assembled using 7kb M13 scaffold and around 200 helper DNA staples. The DNA was also functionalized with 19 cholesterol anchors to facilitate insertion into a lipid membrane. Not only the size of the pore was larege but also conductance was 10-fold larger compared to previous man-made channels. The paper also had a supplementary movie attached from MD simulation that I would like to show you. You will see the pore structure from various angles during equilibration phase at the end you will also see part of Ion transport simulation.</p>
<p>Another exciting example is a nanodevice created by Philip Ketterer and his colegues, a nanoscale rotary apparatus that takes us a step toward devising nanomachines similar to bacterial flagellar motor or ATP synthase. The rotor was designed to restrein its motion to one rotatory degree of freedom but without restricting the angular range of rotation. Device is constructed from three different DNA origami fragments: a rotor unit and two clamp elements. The body of the rotor unit is ~32 nm long and the diameter of the envelope cyilnder is around 22 nm. Once those three different units are ready they are put together for assembly, this process is presented on the following video. The hybridization between sequence-complementary DNA single strands distributed across the clamp elements strengthen the bond between the two clamp units. Then the structure is further strengthen by the brackets that rigidify the device and irreversibly trap the rotor in the cavity.</p>
<p>I would also like to show you another video that show the device in action. The movement is performend in form of random walk around the central axis.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="drug-delivery">
<h1>Drug delivery</h1>
<p>Probably the most seductive prospect for DNA nanotechnology is as effective drug-delivery nanovehicles. THe illustration of this concept is a box with a lid that I have already showed you earlier. Most exciting thing about this idea is that DNA nanobox can be programmed to deliver thier cargo and releases it only in specific conditions, therby maximizing potency while minimizing side effects. However as we know from last week presentation efficient drug delivery is extremely difficult task. The positive feature about DNA nanostructures is precise controll over shape, size and mechanical flexibility. Clearly, proper control over these aspects is crucial to drug delivery. More over DNA nanovehicles can be functionalized with numerous different molecules. Those two characteristics make DNA devices superior to other nanodevices, or at least according to authors that deals with this subject.</p>
<p>As for to day there is no DNA nanovehicels ready to use, however there is lot of work in on going phase. I have choosen one such work from 2012 by Shawn Douglas and others to show you an example on what stage those works are. In the paper titled 'A Logic-Gated Nanorobot for Targeted Transport of Molecular Payloads' they describe creation of DNA nanovehicle in barrel like shape of size 35 x 34 x 45 nm. As you can see the barrel consist of two domains that are covalently attached by single-standed scaffold hinges, and can be fastened in front by staples that plays role of the lock. Those staples were designed in such a way so they can response to proteins, when binding antigen keys. Notice that there are two such locks, each of them recognize different key so only when both aptamers recognize their targets, the lock duplexes dissociate. Hence Logic-Gate in paper title, becouse this is exacely as AND logic gate works like. Once the lock are gone the nanorobot acts as an entropic spring and undergoes a drastic reconfiguration to expose its cargo. In this particular example nanorobots were loaded with combinations of fluorescently labeled antibody fragments, as to visualize the outcome. But also they successfully conducted a test with antiboides to human CD33 and human CDw328 Fab' (receptors) fragments that have been shown to induce growth arrest in leukemic cells.</p>

<div class="section" id="ferementation">
<h1>Ferementation</h1>
<p>When you hear that DNA is beaing used  to build materials, one question immediately presents itself: Can this material be reproduced biologically. As for 2010 two structures were reproduced by cloning but those were not wery sophisticated topologicaly. One of them was octahedron. So far we have no answer wheter it will be possible to reproduce complex structures.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="challenges">
<h1>CHALLENGES!!</h1>
<p>To sum up my talk and come to some conlusion I would like to point out some important challenges for DNA nanotechnology.
Despite extraordiary advancements and achivements in structural DNA nanotechnology, its applicability still remains a matter of debate. Undoubtedly, DNA origami technology provides a powerful tool to organize and manipulate molecules on the nanometer length scale. Nevertheless, as a consequence of the limited chemical, optical and electronic properties of DNA the functionalization of DNA structures is mandatory for their full exploitation. This problem was saw by people of this field quite early and is already addressed by various strategies for chemical modification and functionalization of DNA nanostructures so as to enable applications in diverse fields of science.</p>
<p>The original goal of structural DNA nanotechnology was to produce designed
periodic matter. Today reacherchers can easly assembly two-dimensional
crystals from robust motifs and characterize them using AFM methods. In
fact preparation of 2D DNA structures is widely used as an introductionary
excercise to structural DNA nanotechnology. More recently researchers
started to create three dimensional crystals - those have to be examined
using X-ray crystalography. As I mentioned before the initial goal of
structural DNA nanotechnology was to organize biological macromolecules
resistant to crystalization by traditional methdods, like membrane protein
. However at current level there are problems with resolution of DNA 3D
structures. In 2010 the best achieved resolution was 4A. So there is still
some way to go, becouse reasons for this lack of accuracy are not fully
understand.[2] Nevertheless DNA nanotechnology have also done other things
in field of macromolecular structure determination. For example detergent
resistant liquid
crystals of DNA nanotubes have allowed weak-alignment NMR studies of
membrane proteins -- example is recent de nove NMR study of UCP2 a 33 kDa
six-transmembrane helix inner mitochondiral membrane protein.[1]</p>
<p>Algorithmic Assembly Winfree 60-62 Sierpinski triangle</p>
<p>Fourth dimension in DNA nanotechnology can be introduced by exploiting
some sort of transition that can be induced, so DNA structure could change
it's arrangement over time. As it apears there is number of different ways
to achieve that. The first such device was based on transition from right-handed B-DNA to left handed Z-DNA(72). There are two conditions needed for
B-Z tranzition, a sequence capable of undergoing it readily and solution
condition to promote it. So it is possible to control how much of DNA
undergo the transition, using sequence, and control direction of those
transitions, by controling solution conditions. Other devices have been
build to exploit the transition of oligo-dC sequences to the I form of
DNA. Thanks to pH dependence of this device it could be used to measure
intracellular pH by combining it with fluorescent labels. (72) As intriguing
the DNA devices may be when based on structural transition, the true
power of DNA is its programmability, single-trugger structural transitions
can lead to only a few variants even with nuanced DNA cheistry. The
first sequence dependent device was a molecular tweezers constructed by
Yurke and his colleagues. Clocked DNA walkers have been developed
using the very same rules 77,78.[2]</p>
<p>Yet another long term goal are biomimetic systems. Feyman famously wrote
on a blackboard: &quot;What I cannot create, I do not understand.&quot;. Biomimetic
systems can setve as simple models for more complex systems, but also as a foundation for inspiring
development of useful materials and devices. A long-term challenge for the DNA-nanostructure
field is to generate an artificial cell in which most of the functional
behaviour is provided by DNA. This goal will not be achieved any time soon,
but mimics of various natural macromolecular machines is belived to be
achivable in near term. 122 For example DNA nanostructures could be
designed as bio-inspired nanopores, functionalization of oligonucleotides
with hydrophobic molecules may permit the incorporation of such structures into
lipid bilayers. Possibility to shape DNA with nanoprecision might offer
improvements over the current state of the art for nanopore-based DNA sequencing. [1]</p>
<p>Interesting idea is the use of DNA nanostructures as a molecular pegboard. For
example in photoncs the main obstacle ramais control over placement of molecular
entities at nanoscale level. This could be done using DNA nanostrucutres to
for example put ligh-harvesting complexes in close contact with charge transfer
units in modular fashion. This idea, of DNA motherboards, becomes even more probable when you consider
that DNA has the ability to transport ccharge over considerable distances
along its bases due to its oxitation. [1]</p>
<p>DNA is also though to be used as a smart glue that can be combined with
other nanoparticles like gold (82). The difference between free gold
nanoparticles is easly seen as those bound with DNA have different color.[2]</p>
<p>The question that comes to mind when we hear that DNA is being used to
build materials, is wheter this material migt be reprodyced biologically,
rather than by complex laboratory procedure. As so far this question has
not been answered properly. As for 2010 two teams were able to do
something like this but in both cases the structure that were obtained
are called trivial, like strands folding into an octahedron.[2]</p>
<p>Undoubtly the most exciting feature about DNA structural nanotechnology,
is possibility to pragram intermolecular affinity. Thanks to usage of
DNA complmentarity and the ability of complemetary strands to hybrydize
one could program structure so it could change under special conditions.[2]</p>
<p>When talking about some life science technology it's not unexpected that
it has potential as therapeutics for human health. Probably the most
seductive prospect of DNA nanotechnology in this matter are drug-delivery
nanovehicles. To illustrate a toy verion of this concept, a hollow DNA-based
box was assembled with a lid that could be opened by strand displacement
with a specific oligonucleotide key (43). The implication is that responsive
nanoboxes could be programmed to deliver their toxic cargoes in a specific
fashion, therby maximizing potency while minimizing side effects. In reality
efficient drug delivery through systemic administration remains extremely
difficult task, as multiple barriers must be overcome before the nanoparticles
can come close to specific release of cargo to the intended molecular target.
Those barriers are for example: macrophages, or plasma membrane. DNA nanostructures
can help overcome these barries by offering inprecedented control over shape,
size, mechanical flexibility and anisotropic surface modification. Clearly,
proper control over these aspects can increase circulation times, but current
knowlege is insuficient to make use of this control. Moreover mimesis of viral
strategies for escaping endosomal compartments into the cytoplasm can in
principle be addressed with the additional control over surface functionalization
afforded by DNA nanostructures. More over advances in DNA computing may lead
to systems that could response to given type of for example cancer. Such system
could relese apropiate drug in presence of specific cancer. [1]</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Not only possibilities offered by DNA structural nanotechnology are
exciting but also the growth of this field. Around the 2000 there was
only one laboratory working at the matter, and in 2010 there was already
50-60 laboratories involved in the effort.[2]</p>
